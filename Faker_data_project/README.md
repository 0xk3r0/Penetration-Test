Actual limit will depend on factors like the available memory, processing power,<br>
And and the specific resources of the system where the code is running.<br>
You can generate as many rows as your system can handle without running out of<br> 
memory or encountering performance issues. However, keep in mind that generating<br>an extremely 
large number of rows could lead to resource exhaustion or performance degradation.
